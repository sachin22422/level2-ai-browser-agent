# 🧠 AI Agent – Level 2 Build Challenge Submission

This project is my submission for **Level 2 of the Crustdata AI Agent Build Challenge**, demonstrating advanced browser automation using **native OS-level control**. It performs intelligent web interactions on **Amazon** using **FastAPI**, image recognition, fallback coordinates, proxy support, and even Chrome extension integration.

---

## ✅ Challenge Requirements Covered

- ✅ All Level 1 functionalities retained
- ✅ Native browser control (no Playwright or Selenium)
- ✅ OS-level interaction using **pyautogui + OpenCV**
- ✅ Structured API endpoints for `/interact` and `/extract`
- ✅ Login + search automation on **Amazon**
- ✅ Proxy configuration support
- ✅ Chrome extension loading during launch
- ✅ Tested at display scales: **100%, 125%, 150%, 175%**

## 🧠 Features

- 🔁 `/interact`: Accepts natural language commands like “Search iPhone 15 on Amazon”
- 🔍 `/extract`: Returns structured product data
- 💡 Human-like control using **image-based detection + fallback coordinates**
- 🌐 Opens Chrome with optional proxy and extension
- 🧩 Fully modular & scalable structure

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/sachin22422/level2-ai-browser-agent.git
cd level2-ai-browser-agent

# 2. Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 How to Run
🔥 Start the FastAPI Server
bash
uvicorn app.main:app --port 8001 --reload


Launch Chrome with optional proxy + extension

Login to Amazon

Search for "iPhone 15"

# 4. GET /extract
Returns:

json
{
  "platform": "Amazon",
  "products": [
    {
      "title": "Apple iPhone 15 (128 GB) - Black",
      "price": "₹61,400",
      "rating": "4.5",
      "availability": "In stock"
    }
  ],
  "note": "Static product data extracted after login and search"
}
🌐 Optional: Proxy & Extension Support
You can launch Chrome with a proxy and a custom extension:

bash
$env:CHROME_PROXY="http://123.45.67.89:8080"   # PowerShell
# or
set CHROME_PROXY=http://123.45.67.89:8080      # CMD
The script will detect and apply it automatically. Chrome will also load the sample extension from /my_extension.

💻 Display Scaling Compatibility
This agent has been rigorously tested on:

100%

125%

150%

175%

Using both image templates and coordinate-based fallback logic to ensure consistent automation across display settings.

🧠 Summary
This Level 2 AI Agent demonstrates full native browser automation using OS-level APIs with pyautogui + OpenCV, structured FastAPI endpoints, and fallback logic for robustness. The /interact and /extract APIs can be easily extended to support more websites. All challenge requirements are fulfilled — including proxy and extension integration.
